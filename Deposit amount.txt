Deposit amount:
   The customer have to enter their account number, if the account number is present in accounts then it will print "account doesn't exist" . if an account is found with the given account number then the customer is asked to enter the amount s/he want to deposit.
The deposited money will be added to the total balance.
This transaction will also be added to transaction history.
----------------------------------------------
Here is the code implementation :

void deposit()
{
cout<<"Enter Account No."<<endl;
int acc;
cin>>acc;
listnode* ptr=lst;
while(ptr!=NULL)
{
      Bank* cust=ptr->obj;

if(cust->acc_number==acc)
{

   cout<<"Amount to deposit"<<endl;
   int amt;
   cin>>amt;
   cust->balance+=amt;
   cust->trans_history.push(amt);
   break;
}
ptr=ptr->next;
}
if(ptr==NULL)
 cout<<"Account doesn't exist"<<endl;
}
