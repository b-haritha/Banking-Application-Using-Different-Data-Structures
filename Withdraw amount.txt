Withdraw amount:
   The customer have to enter their account number, if the account number is present in accounts then it will print "account doesn't exist" . if an account is found with the given account number then the customer is asked to enter the amount s/he want to withdraw.
The withdrawn money will be deducted from the total balance.
This transaction will also be added to transaction history.
----------------------------------------------
Here is the code implementation :

void withdraw()
{
cout<<"Enter Account No."<<endl;
int acc;
cin>>acc;
listnode* ptr=lst;
int flag=1;
while(ptr!=NULL)
{
      Bank* cust=ptr->obj;

if(cust->acc_number==acc)
{
flag=0;
   cout<<"Enter Amount to Withdraw"<<endl;
   int amt;
   cin>>amt;
   if(cust->balance<amt)
      cout<<"No Enough Balance"<<endl;
   else
   {

   cust->balance-=amt;
   cust->trans_history.push((amt*-1));
}
   break;
}
ptr=ptr->next;
}
if(flag)
 cout<<"Account doesn't exist"<<endl;

}
