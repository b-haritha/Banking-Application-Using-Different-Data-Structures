For Creating an account and for holding all the accounts together we have to create a struct named Bank and a linked list.
We want to hold basic details of the customer like their name, account number, balance and their transaction history.
for holding name we declare a string variable, for account number int or long int variable according to the requirement, for holding balance double or float, for holding transaction history a stack of integers is created.
For holding all the accounts together we created a Linkedlist called listnode. it just have a next and head pointers and object of Bank struct.

------------------
Here is the implementation:



struct Bank
{
string name;
int acc_number;
float balance;
stack<long int> trans_history;
};




struct listnode
{
Bank* obj;
listnode* next;
listnode* head;
};
